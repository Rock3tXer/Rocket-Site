### Visual changes and switch to Hugo

The old versions of Rocket site didn't really have any purpose. They were created by me to practise HTML and CSS. That practise wasn't regular it was more like a hunch.
When I felt like practising it I created a new version with slightly different design. But since the last version (that can be seen in the picture) I left the project rot in the files. But now since I'm older and I might need a portfolio soon for stuff like job interviews or side hustles I decided to revive this project and repurpose it.

While planing the new site design I started researching other ways to build a proper site. During the research I found out about [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Static site generator
that makes things easier. It has a lot of documentation which makes it easy to learn and pretty big community that makes themes for it. So I started
learning to work with it and ended using it for this project.
