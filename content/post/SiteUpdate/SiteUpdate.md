### Visual changes and switch to Hugo

The old versions of the Rocket site didn't really have any purpose. They were created by me to practice HTML and CSS. That practice wasn't regular, it was more like a hunch.
When I felt like practicing I created a new version with a slightly different design. You can see all site versions in the gif embedded in the article.
I left the project inactive for a long time and stopped with web dev completely. But for the past few weeks, I got bored and I decided to revive this project and repurpose it as my personal website.

While planning the new site design I started researching other ways to build a proper site. During the research, I found out about [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Static site generator
that makes things easier. It has a lot of documentation which makes it easy to learn and a pretty big community that makes themes for it. So I started
learning to work with it and ended up using it for this project.
