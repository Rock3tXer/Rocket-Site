Hello! 
My name is **Adrian**. But on the internet, I go by as **Rock3tXer** or **Rocket**. I’m 19yo student trying to learn software development and art. 

The foundation of my learning came from high school where I learned the basics of Python and C++. For the final high school project, I made a  [game](https://github.com/Rock3tXer/Simple-2D-Platformer/) using **[UNITY](https://unity.com/)** engine coded in C#. 
Since then I don’t have any new projects that I’m working on; instead, I’m focusing more on the art part. 
As you can see in my Projects section there is a Pixel Art post where I’ll post all my finished pieces. 

But that doesn’t mean I’m not planning any projects in the near future. I’ve got some concepts in mind but for them to work I need to practice more and get better at programming. So until I start some new big projects I’ll try to work on some small ones to practice. If they end up being good I might link them under the Projects section. 

But for now, I’m glad you came to check out my site!
